# sqlite_practice
This repository contains a collection of SQLite exercises accompanied by my personal solutions. the exercises are designed to help improve SQL query writing and database management skills using SQLite.

All exercises are originally sourced from the [wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL_Exercises), where the challenges were curated for learning and practice purposes. This repo contains my own solutions for each exercise to aid understanding and self-study.
